# TMService

### Some lirycal begining

:wave:Well, hello there, my dear reader!:wave:
Let's figure out what TMService is 
and why you need it.:expressionless:

:angry:So let me begin with explaining my pain and headache.:angry:
If you live in a big city :city_sunrise: and sometimes 
you see how long city administrations 
are building landscaping for a comfortable 
life, then you once asked yourself: 

_"How I can help:question: 
What can I do:question:"._

And Trouble Map Service is the 
answer for this difficult question:exclamation:

### What's special about TMS?

__At first__ TMS isn't a traditional form submission service :page_with_curl:, it's more like a mapping service :earth_africa:. __But why?__ 
What's simple, our cities aren't many 
points :red_circle: on an imaginary map, It's more like 
a big organisms, It's alive:seedling:! They also have organs, 
just like us, like a city center, roads, residential 
areas.

### "And you that will be usefull?" - It might be.

:anger:___"Oh, the road here would 
not interfere with us, otherwise the whole area leaves 
through the passage in the south and there are a lot of 
damn traffic jams!"___:anger:

:sparkles:With TMS your pain can be easily soothed. All you need 
to do is just to put your point on our map. Then someone 
else will like this point, then someone else, and so on, 
until people in the administration of your city see this 
point, because it will increase!:sparkles:

# That's about functional?
So at the begining of our lovely project it'll be a site, but one day I want to see it in application.
__What about working with site?__ At first you see many dots on map (Yo, what?) and there is one that
is _grey_ colored, it's your's, you can grab it and leave it in any place of map, what's next? So you
can click on this dot and leave a description of problem or suggestion what you have on this place, 
then you can choose kind of problem from our list, it can be:

* Social problem
* Landscaping problem
* Traffic problem
* Availability problem
* Environmental problem

Then you just need to apply your dot placing and that's all, everybody now see it and can like it.
More likes on your dot - More it'll increase. But where's one rule: if it has less than 100 likes until 24 hours it'll disapear.
And that's all!
