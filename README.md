# TMService
______
Well, hello there, my dear reader! 
Let's figure out what TMService is 
and why you need it.

So let me begin with explaining my pain and headache. 
If you live in a big city and sometimes 
you see how long city ​​administrations 
are building landscaping for a comfortable 
life, then you once asked yourself: "How I can help? 
What can I do?". And Trouble Map Service is the 
answer for this difficult question.

Isn't TMS a boring, traditional form submission service? 

No! Because it's a mapping service.

But why it's a mapping service?

What's simple, our cities aren't many 
points on an imaginary map, It's more like 
a big organisms, It's alive! They also have organs, 
just like us, like a city center, roads, residential 
areas.

You can remember that feel, then you think "Oh, the road here would 
not interfere with us, otherwise the whole area leaves 
through the passage in the south and there are a lot of 
damn traffic jams!"

With TMS your pain can be easily soothed. All you need 
to do is just to put your point on our map. Then someone 
else will like this point, then someone else, and so on, 
until people in the administration of your city see this 
point, because it will increase!
